# PyLogo

PyLogo is a Python implementation of elements of [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/).

* The `core` directory contains the NetLogo implementation.
* The `models` directory contains a number of example models. Each example can be run by running the file.

PyLogo uses [_pygame_](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) and [_pySimpleGui_](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), two very nice libraries. It also makes minimal use of [_NumPy_](https://numpy.org/). All three libraries must be installed.
